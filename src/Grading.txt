Great work!

One point off on your layout, because you didn't indent inside your for loops.  
Not a huge deal, but your code will be easier to read and debug if you
consistently indent inside your for loops.

One point off for pseudocode, because you do have a block comment at the
top, but it mostly just describes the assignment, not how your code will
be structured.

No points off, but you have a couple of for loops that only run one time.
You don't need to use for loops there.  You can just do the print statement. :)
